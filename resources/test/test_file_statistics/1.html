 Percentage of diffusely reflected sunlight in relation to various surface conditions 
 
 
 Albedo  ( Template:IPAc-en ), or  reflection coefficient , derived from  Latin   albedo  "whiteness" (or reflected sunlight) in turn from  albus  "white," is the  diffuse reflectivity  or reflecting power of a surface. It is the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it. Its  dimensionless  nature lets it be expressed as a percentage and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflection of a perfectly black surface to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surface. 
 Albedo depends on the  frequency  of the radiation. When quoted unqualified, it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of  visible light . In general, the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incident radiation, except for  Lambertian surfaces , which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function and therefore have an albedo that is independent of the incident distribution. In practice, a  bidirectional reflectance distribution function  (BRDF) may be required to accurately characterize the scattering properties of a surface, but albedo is very useful as a first approximation. 
 The albedo is an important concept in  climatology ,  astronomy , and calculating  reflectivity  of surfaces in  LEED  sustainable-rating systems for buildings. The average overall albedo of Earth, its  planetary albedo , is 30 to 35% because of cloud cover, but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features. [1] 
 The term was introduced into optics by  Johann Heinrich Lambert  in his 1760 work  Photometria .

 Albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a  black body . When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4. [7]  The average albedo of the  Earth  is about 0.3. [8]  This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.

 The Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via  Earth observation  satellite sensors such as  NASA 's  MODIS  instruments on board the  Terra  and  Aqua  satellites. As the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite, a  mathematical model  of the BRDF is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of  directional-hemispherical reflectance  and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g. [9] ). 
 The Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the  greenhouse effect  is currently about 15 °C. If the Earth was frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective) the average temperature of the planet would drop below −40 °C [10]  If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0 °C. [11]  In contrast, if all the ice on Earth were to melt—a so-called aquaplanet—the average temperature on the planet would rise to just under 27 °C. [12] 
 White-sky and black-sky albedo 
 It has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo, the albedo at a particular  solar zenith angle   θ i  can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle, 
#(start)# #('v!α','m!()1x1','n')# #('m!()1x1','v!θ','w')# #('v!θ','v!i','b')# #('v!α','¯','o')# #(end)#
   , and the bi-hemispherical reflectance, 
#(start)# #('m!1x1','¯','o')# #('m!1x1','v!α','w')# #('v!α','¯','o')# #(end)#
   the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination 

   . 
 Albedo 

   can then be given as: 
 

#(start)# #('v!α','=','n')# #('=','m!()1x1','n')# #('m!()1x1','v!α','n')# #('v!α','m!()1x1','n')# #('m!()1x1','+','n')# #('+','v!d','n')# #('v!d','m!1x1','n')# #('m!1x1','.','n')# #('m!1x1','¯','o')# #('m!1x1','v!α','w')# #('v!α','¯','o')# #('m!()1x1','v!θ','w')# #('v!θ','v!i','b')# #('v!α','¯','o')# #('m!()1x1','n!1','w')# #('n!1','-','n')# #('-','v!d','n')# #(end)#
  
 
 Directional-hemispherical reflectance  is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and  bi-hemispherical reflectance  as white-sky albedo. These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface. [13] 
 Astronomical albedo 
 The albedos of  planets ,  satellites  and  asteroids  can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle ("phase angle"), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of  photometry . For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about  regolith  properties, while unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metallic content in  asteroids . 
 Enceladus , a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected. Another notable high-albedo body is  Eris , with an albedo of 0.96. [14]  Many small objects in the outer solar system [15]  and  asteroid belt  have low albedos down to about 0.05. [16]  A typical  comet nucleus  has an albedo of 0.04. [17]  Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily  space weathered  surface containing some  organic compounds . 
 The overall albedo of the  Moon  is around 0.12, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong  opposition effect . [18]  While such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the  regolith  surfaces of airless solar system bodies. 
 Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band)  geometric albedo  (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the  Bond albedo  (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion. 
 In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five  Hapke parameters  which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with  phase angle , including a characterization of the opposition effect of  regolith  surfaces. 
 The correlation between astronomical (geometric) albedo,  absolute magnitude  and diameter is: [19]  
#(start)# #('v!a','=','n')# #('=','m!()1x1','n')# #('m!()1x1','n!2','a')# #('m!()1x1','f!','w')# #('f!','n!1329','o')# #('n!1329','×','n')# #('×','n!10','n')# #('n!10','-','a')# #('-','v!h','n')# #('v!h','/','n')# #('/','n!5','n')# #('f!','v!d','u')# #(end)#

 Examples of terrestrial albedo effects 
 Illumination 
 Although the albedo–temperature effect is best known in colder, whiter regions on Earth, the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where year-round illumination is greater. The maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere, varying between three and twelve degrees north. [20]  The minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres, beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination. [20] 
 Insolation effects 
 The intensity of albedo temperature effects depend on the amount of albedo and the level of local  insolation ; high albedo areas in the  arctic  and  antarctic  regions are cold due to low insolation, where areas such as the  Sahara Desert , which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation.  Tropical  and  sub-tropical   rain forest  areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their  temperate forest  counterparts, which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes.

 Climate and weather 
 Albedo affects  climate  and drives  weather . All weather is a result of the uneven heating of the Earth caused by different areas of the planet having different albedos. Essentially, for the driving of weather, there are two types of albedo regions on Earth: Land and ocean. Land and ocean regions produce the four basic different types of  air masses , depending on latitude and therefore  insolation : Warm and dry, which form over tropical and sub-tropical land masses; warm and wet, which form over tropical and sub-tropical oceans; cold and dry which form over temperate, polar and sub-polar land masses; and cold and wet, which form over temperate, polar and sub-polar oceans. Different temperatures between the air masses result in different air pressures, and the masses develop into  pressure systems . High pressure systems flow toward lower pressure, driving weather from north to south in the northern hemisphere, and south to north in the lower; however due to the spinning of the Earth, the  Coriolis effect  further complicates flow and creates several weather/climate bands and the  jet streams . 
 Albedo–temperature feedback 
 When an area's albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow–temperature  feedback  results. A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g. a warm  air mass ), the lowered albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback. However, because local  weather  is dynamic due to the change of  seasons , eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher  insolation ) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass or soil, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus increasing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating. 
 Small-scale effects 
 Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing. [21] 
 Trees 
 Because forests are generally attributed a low albedo, (as the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through  photosynthesis ), it has been erroneously assumed that removing forests would lead to cooling on the grounds of increased albedo. Through the  evapotranspiration  of water, trees discharge excess heat from the forest canopy. This water vapour rises resulting in  cloud cover  which also has a high albedo, thereby further increasing the net global cooling effect attributable to forests Template:Citation needed . 
 In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily.  Deciduous trees  have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas  coniferous trees  have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15. [4] 
 Studies by the  Hadley Centre  have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of  carbon sequestration  on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming. [22] 
 Snow 
 Snow albedos can be as high as 0.9; this, however, is for the ideal example: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over  Antarctica  they average a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo  positive feedback ).  Cryoconite , powdery windblown  dust  containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets. [23] 
 Water 
 Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the  Fresnel equations  (see graph). 
 
 File:Water reflectivity.jpg 
 Reflectivity of smooth water at 20 °C (refractive index=1.333) 
 
 
 At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally  specular manner  (not  diffusely ). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small  angles of incident  light,  waviness  results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle. [24] 
 Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it increases tremendously at high angles of incident light such as occur on the illuminated side of the Earth near the  terminator  (early morning, late afternoon and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Since the light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light. 
 Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh ‘black’ ice exhibits Fresnel reflection. 
 Clouds 
 Cloud albedo  has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. "On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth." [25] 
 Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the  contrails  of heavy commercial airliner traffic. [26]  A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10 °C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies. [27] 
 Aerosol effects 
 Aerosols  (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on the Earth’s radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as  cloud condensation nuclei  and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain. [28]  As per  [29]  the effects are: 
 
 
 Aerosol direct effect.  Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation. The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming. 
 Aerosol indirect effect.  Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called  cloud condensation nuclei . Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling ( first indirect effect ), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud ( second indirect effect ). 
 
 
 Black carbon 
 Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from  black carbon  particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m −2 , with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m −2 . [30]  Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo. [31] 
 Human activities 
 Human activities (e.g. deforestation, farming, and urbanization) change the albedo of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult. Template:Citation needed 
 Other types of albedo 
 Single-scattering albedo  is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material ( refractive index ); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.
